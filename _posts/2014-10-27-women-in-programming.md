title: "Women in Programming"
---


I recently came across
[this](https://wrightaprilm.github.io/posts/lonely.html)
blog post.

I don't have to enumerate everything that is wrong 
about what April Wright had to go through that day.
But as someone who really cares about *community*
in programming, science, and learning in general,
I'm moved to be a part of the effort to *do something*
about it.

I just don't know where to start.

So if you're a woman in programming, please help.
If you have ideas, leave me a note (ashwinsrnth@gmail.com).
[Here](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Phhc5A2tv8) is a more
public and anonymous platform that I will keep an eye on.
If you are already active (as part of a community or otherwise)
in getting more women to program - please let me know,
I'd love to contribute in some way.
I do a bit of teaching programming. Every workshop
I've done on programming has had less than 20% women
(apparently, this is "typical" in computer science education).
You can reach out to a better audience - all my material
is available for review and improvement, and I'd love to be
able to collaborate with you in making it happen.

And please, spread the word.
